# Source Management & Extraction Under Load Shedding

  The source management is an important aspect of energy management, especially in a scenario where demand for electricity exceeds the capacity of primary energy sources.
  
  Load shedding is used to relieve stress on primary energy sources. That would be done by shifting a load from the LabVIEW software is used to implement the load management strategies in this research paper. LabVIEW is a powerful software tool that allows for the development of custom test and measurement systems, making it ideal for implementing load management strategies in a hybrid energy system.



## Benefits 
### For  Source  Extraction :

•	To utilize renewable energy sources (wind and solar) for optimizing the demand.

•	To design and Implement  Hybrid Energy System.

•	To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the implemented system through experiment.

•	To promote sustainable energy practices and reduce the carbon footprint.

### For Utility :

•	It helps to reduce the market price for utility by freeing the utility from the expenses of building backup plant that are brought online to cope the demand.

•	It reduces the costs of managing the electricity grid.

•	Availability of constant load on grid, so need of extra generation.

•	To reduce stress on primary energy Sources.

###	For Consumer :

•	Consumer can reduce their electricity bills by adjusting the timing and amount of electricity use.

•	Consumer can control the loading by deciding their own priority.

•	Active participation of consumer leads in saving.
